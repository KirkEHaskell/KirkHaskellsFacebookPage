OVERVIEW

The AI class is part of a Java project that implements artificial neural networks.
These networks are designed for machine learning and can be used for various tasks, such as
pattern recognition, classification, and function approximation. The project creates an AI data type
wich can be trained itteratively to learn a set of data


Methods:

AI(int rows, int columns, int nets): Constructor for creating an instance of the AI class.

setLearningSet(List<List<Double>> newInputSet, List<List<Double>> newOutputSet, int sets): Set the input and output sets for training.

learnRandomly(int generations, double mutationFactor): Train the neural networks randomly for a specified number of generations.

calculateGrades(): Calculate the performance grades of each neural network based on the training data.

findBestGrade(): Identify the best-performing neural network.

randomizeNetworks(double mutationFactor): Introduce random mutations to the neural networks.

setToBestAI(): Set all other neural networks to the configuration of the best-performing network.

learnBimodaly(int generations, double mutationAmount): Train the networks using a bimodal learning approach.

useAI(List<Double> inputs): Use the best-performing neural network to make predictions.

setAllFunctions(String newFunction): Set activation functions for all networks.

setColumnFunctions(String newFunction, int column): Set activation functions for specific columns in all networks.
